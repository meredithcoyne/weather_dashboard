# Weather Dashboard

This Weather Dashboard allows you to input a city, which saves in local storage for later use to pull. The dashboard pulls data across the form from two API's through [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

## Functionality

* When searching for a city, the current and future conditions for that city will be presented and that city is added to the search history
  
* When viewing current weather conditions for the city, the following is shown:
  * City name
  * Date
  * Weather Icon of current conditions
  * Temperature
  * Humidity
  * Wind speed
  * UV index
  
* When viewing the UV index, it is presented with a color indicating severity: 
  * ![#3EA72D](https://via.placeholder.com/15/3EA72D/000000?text=+) 0-2 Low
  * ![#FFF300](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFF300/000000?text=+) 3-5 Moderate
  * ![#E53210](https://via.placeholder.com/15/E53210/000000?text=+) 6-10 Very High

  
* When viewing the future weather conditions for the city, a 5-day forecast will be presented with the following information:
